# I Want To Help Android School
>Yeah, I want to stop war from the world.

That's cool, you are welcome to help in everything you can, it does not matter if you are a Nearsoft employee or not.

**These are a few things that you can do to help us:**

1. Code Labs
2. Propose new simple-app ideas for future a class
3. Give a talk!
4. Help us with the organization (logistics)
5. Improve this document

# How to really help
## Improve our Code Labs or create a new one
Code labs are small ordered exercises that assistants have to complete over the
6 sessions.

If you want to create a Code lab please do the following:

0. Create an [issue](https://github.com/Nearsoft/androidschool/issues) in Github for the proposal.
2. Create your own branch (or fork the project)
2. Add a directory in the corresponding event
    - If there is no event for your idea/app please create it.
3. Add a subdirectory for the code lab named: `codelab`
4. Use an ordered way to categorize your excercises, example: `25Feb2017` or `day_one`
5. Inside of each day, add different markdown files per topic.
    - Try to not add *everything* in a **single file**, try to explain it. - [Example](/2017/feb_event/todoapp/codelab/25Feb2017/01_setup.md)
6. Create a Pull Request to master and tag someone from the team.

**BTW**: Language does matter, use spanish or english, do not mix the code lab, if
you want to provide a translation, please add a directory with the language code

Example: `todoapp-fr`

## Propose new simple-app ideas for future a class
>Hey, the first event idea came 3 days before the first class.

If you want to contribute here, just think about something easy to create:

**Examples:**
- foursquare clone
- todo list app
- alarm manager

Just provide us with your idea in an [issue](https://github.com/Nearsoft/androidschool/issues) and we will contact you!

It is better if you have this info:

- Description
- Libraries to use
- Some sketches
- **Code** - it is not needed, if you are a designer you can provide better sketches.

## Give a talk!
>Android Talks!

If you want to contribute with a talk, you just need to create your slides.

**Examples:**
1. [Android School intro](http://slides.com/josesalcido-1/android-4#/)
2. [Java and the Object Oriented  Programming Principle](http://slides.com/josesalcido-1/object-oriented-programming#/)

Then, contact us to include it in the next event, or create an [issue](https://github.com/Nearsoft/androidschool/issues) and wait for response from someone on the team.

## Help us with the organization (logistics)
> It is really important, logistics is almost 90% of the success of an event.

You can do a lot of things in order to help us here:

- Come up early and help with the setup of the venue (Nearsoft offices)
- Help on each class
- Food and Drinks!
- Contact Christian!!!
