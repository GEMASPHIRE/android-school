# Repository Organization
> How to organize stuff

## Directories

It is easier to understand where is everything if we have organization in the directory structure, if you are looking for code labs of 2017 February events, you go [here](/2017/feb_event/todoapp).

The current organization of directories is:

`{year}/{start_month|event_name}/{app_name}/{source&codelab}`

---

## Documents

All documentation should be in a directory named `docs`. Usage of markdown is enforced.

---

## Code Conventions

If you plan to add code to any of the applications or add a new one, remember to add a code convention, if there is no code convention the default to use will be the Google Java code style:

https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html

** Report and fix any code that does not follow the  convention. **
